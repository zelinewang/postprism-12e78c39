📅 Deployment Date: 2025年 8月 4日 星期一 23时49分30秒 PDT

🎯 Next: Ready for merge to main branch

🌳 BRANCH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
├── 📦 cloud-demo-backup: Backup snapshot before backend deployment work
├── 🎯 main: Production-ready branch for frontend updates via Lovable
├── 🛠️ development: Legacy development branch (previous dev work)
├── ☁️ cloud-deployment: Dedicated backend cloud deployment branch
└── 📋 WORKFLOW:
    • All future development should branch from 'main'
    • Frontend updates: main → Lovable deployment
    • Backend deployment testing: main → cloud-deployment → test → merge back
    • Keep cloud-deployment as staging area for backend deployment experiments

🔄 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW DIAGRAM:
    New Feature Development:
    main ──→ feature/new-feature ──→ main ──→ Lovable Deploy

    Backend Deployment Testing:
    main ──→ cloud-deployment ──→ Render Deploy ──→ test ──→ main

📝 QUICK COMMANDS:
    # Start new feature development
    git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature/your-feature

    # Prepare backend deployment testing
    git checkout cloud-deployment && git merge main

    # Update frontend on Lovable
    git checkout main && git push origin main
  \IMPORTANT: Always keep main as the single source of truth
