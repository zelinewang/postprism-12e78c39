📅 Deployment Date: 2025年 8月 4日 星期一 23时49分30秒 PDT
🔧 Status: Production Ready - No immediate commits needed
📋 Notes: Cloud deployment branch tested and verified working
🎯 Next: Ready for merge to main branch

🌳 BRANCH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
├── 📦 cloud-demo-backup: Backup snapshot before backend deployment work
├── 🎯 main: Production-ready branch for frontend updates via Lovable
├── 🛠️ development: Legacy development branch (previous dev work)
├── ☁️ cloud-deployment: Dedicated backend cloud deployment branch
└── 📋 WORKFLOW:
    • All future development should branch from 'main'
    • Frontend updates: main → Lovable deployment
    • Backend deployment testing: main → cloud-deployment → test → merge back
    • Keep cloud-deployment as staging area for backend deployment experiments
